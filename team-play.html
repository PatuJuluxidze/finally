  <h1>Team Play</h1>
  <p>This is where we will be showing you team play and giving some tips as to how to go about it. It will be broken up ito a few sections that will help you to become a master at team play. <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> We are not, by any means, saying that
    we are team play experts. We just want to help anyone who may be a solo player or someone who hates people, yet plays a team oriented game.</p>
  <h2>Communication</h2>
  <p>Communication is key. I don't call communication: "Hey, how are you doing?" "Oh, I'm ok. How about you?" <strong>No, just NO!</strong> That is <strong>SO</strong> wrong that it makes me sick when I hear that in AirMech. It is more like: "Hey, how's
    your HP?" "It's kinda low... Mind healing me while I go take the objective? I can shield you from blows" Now <strong>THAT'S</strong> more like it. Communication is all about giving your status, calling enemies, and calling attacks or retreats. If
    you don't do that, then I really can't help but not feel bad when your team is absolutely <strong>DOMINATED.</strong>
      <h2>Scouting</h2>
      <p>Scouting is the process of figuring out your opponent(s) skill level(s) before you go up to them and beat them up. For instance, if you were in a Vainglory/League of Legends tournament, you would probably draft characters that you can play well
        <strong>AND</strong> are good against what your opponents have drafted. YOu can also make eliminations of characters based on your opponent(s) skill level with some characters.</p>
