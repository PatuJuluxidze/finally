  <h1>How to Join the RL</h1>
  <p>It is really quite simple, and there are many way of IDing yourself as a member. I will give you guys the steps to join, then I will tell you guys the ways you can ID yourself as a member.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Emali Astirrus with something along the lines of "Hey! I want in on this!"</li>
    <li>Make sure that Astirrus emails you back saying "Your in."</li>
    <li>Use an Identifier to mark you as a member</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By following those steps you can now see the Identifiers that you can use. They vary from game to game, but this is a very easy thing to do.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Halo: In the four letter/digit short name you can give yourself in multiplayer, make the first to numbers RL.</li>
    <li>CSGO: In the Guild Card comment, enter "I got your back." or "Anneux!" and send it to a member.</li>
    <li>Roblox: Be friends with all members that play.</li>
